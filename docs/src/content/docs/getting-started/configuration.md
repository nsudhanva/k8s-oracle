Create `tf-oke/terraform.tfvars` with your environment-specific values. This file is gitignored and should never be committed.

<Aside type="tip">
  After initial deployment, all secrets are stored in OCI Vault. See [Secrets Management](/architecture/secrets-management) for retrieval instructions.

## Variable Reference

| Variable | Description | Stored in Vault |
|----------|-------------|-----------------|
| `tenancy_ocid` | OCI Tenancy OCID from the console | No |
| `user_ocid` | OCI User OCID for API access | No |
| `fingerprint` | API key fingerprint | No |
| `private_key_path` | Path to the OCI API private key | No |
| `compartment_ocid` | Compartment where resources will be created | No |
| `region` | OCI region identifier | No |
| `ssh_public_key_path` | Path to SSH public key in OpenSSH format | Yes |
| `cloudflare_api_token` | Cloudflare API token with Zone.DNS Edit | Yes |
| `cloudflare_zone_id` | Zone ID from Cloudflare dashboard | Yes |
| `domain_name` | Domain for the cluster applications | Yes |
| `acme_email` | Email for Let's Encrypt notifications | Yes |
| `git_repo_url` | HTTPS URL of your forked repository | Yes |
| `git_username` | GitHub username | Yes |
| `git_email` | Email for GHCR authentication | Yes |
| `git_pat` | GitHub Personal Access Token | Yes |
| `argocd_admin_password` | Password for ArgoCD admin user | Yes |
| `argocd_admin_password_hash` | Bcrypt hash of the password (for argocd-secret) | Yes |

<Aside type="note">
  OCI authentication variables are not stored in Vault since they're needed to access Vault. Keep them in a password manager.
</Aside>

## ArgoCD Password Hash

ArgoCD requires a bcrypt hash of the admin password for authentication. Generate it with:

```bash
htpasswd -nbBC 10 "" "your-password" | tr -d ':\n' | sed 's/^\$/\$2a\$/'
```

## SSH Key Format

The SSH public key must be in OpenSSH format, starting with `ssh-rsa` or `ssh-ed25519`. PEM format keys are not accepted by OCI metadata.

To generate a new key:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f ./oci_key -N ""
```

## OCI Always Free Resources

After `terraform apply`, the following Always Free resources are created:

| Resource | Free Tier Limit | Usage |
|----------|-----------------|-------|
| Object Storage | 20 GB | ~1 MB (tfstate) |
| Vault Secrets | 150 | 10 secrets |
| Vault Master Keys | 20 versions | 1 key |
| Ampere A1 Compute | 4 OCPUs, 24 GB RAM | 4 OCPUs, 24 GB |

## Remote State

Terraform state is stored in OCI Object Storage bucket `oke-tfstate` with versioning enabled. The bucket is created during the first apply and reused for subsequent runs.
