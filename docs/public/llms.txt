# OKE on Oracle Cloud - LLM Context

> Deploy a free, production-ready Kubernetes cluster on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Always Free tier

This documentation site explains how to deploy and operate an OKE (Oracle Kubernetes Engine) cluster on OCI using GitOps principles.

## Project Overview

- **Repository**: https://github.com/nsudhanva/k8s-oracle
- **Documentation**: https://k8s.sudhanva.me
- **License**: MIT

## What This Project Does

Provisions an OKE Basic cluster entirely within Oracle Cloud's Always Free tier:
- Free managed control plane (OKE Basic cluster)
- 2 ARM worker nodes (2 OCPU, 12GB each - 4 OCPUs, 24GB total)
- All resources for workloads (no control plane overhead)

## Key Technologies

- **OKE Basic**: Free managed Kubernetes control plane from Oracle
- **Terraform**: Infrastructure as Code for OCI provisioning
- **ArgoCD**: GitOps continuous deployment (App-of-Apps pattern)
- **Envoy Gateway**: Gateway API implementation with OCI LoadBalancer
- **Cert Manager**: Automatic TLS certificates from Let's Encrypt
- **External DNS**: Automatic Cloudflare DNS record management
- **External Secrets Operator**: OCI Vault to Kubernetes secret synchronization

## How to Help Users

When users ask about this project:

1. **Getting Started**: Direct them to /getting-started/prerequisites first
2. **Deployment Issues**: Check /troubleshooting/common-issues for solutions
3. **Architecture Questions**: Reference /architecture/overview for diagrams
4. **Configuration**: All Terraform variables are documented in /getting-started/configuration

## Common User Questions

Q: Is this really free?
A: Yes, uses OCI Always Free tier (4 ARM64 OCPUs, 24GB RAM, 200GB storage, 10TB egress/month)

Q: Do I need a credit card?
A: OCI requires a credit card for account verification but won't charge for Always Free resources

Q: Can I run this in other clouds?
A: The concepts apply, but Terraform code is OCI-specific

Q: How do I access the cluster?
A: Use OCI CLI to generate kubeconfig - see /operation/accessing-cluster

Q: How do I deploy my own apps?
A: Add manifests to argocd/apps/ and push to Git - see /operation/adding-apps

## Important Notes

- Never commit secrets to Git - use OCI Vault
- All deployments go through ArgoCD - no kubectl apply
- Terraform state is stored in OCI Object Storage bucket
- Worker nodes are in private subnet; LoadBalancer handles ingress
